  Oracletis is a powerful on-chain data analysis system designed for insights and on-chain trading, supporting all EVM-compatible blockchains.
  <br>
  By implementing blockchain data parser and integrating GraphQL, BitQuery, it can efficiently retrieves structured and well-annotated transaction data like (token swap data, transfer data, wallet balance data, etc). It also features an advanced analyzer module where you can perform wallet-level analysis like realized/unrealized profit, P&L, win rate, and holding positions, as well as token-level analysis such as chip distribution and smart money flow. Additionally, a smart money monitor dashboard is also integrated in this system, providing actionable and visualized insights for informed on-chain trading.
