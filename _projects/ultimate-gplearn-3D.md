  ultimate-gplearn-3D is an enhanced version of gplearn for 3-Dimensional genetic programming.
  <br>
  This package introduces new fitness functions specifically designed for 3-dimensional factor evolution, alongside a built-in backtesting framework. This allows users to guide the evolutionary process directly based on their strategy's performance. The package now also features an expanded set of base operators for both time-series and cross-sectional operations, and integrates TA-Lib's technical indicators, refined to better suit 3-dimensional factor evolution.
